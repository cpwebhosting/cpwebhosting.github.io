<p style="text-align:justify">WordPress is inarguably most preferred content management system by far for those building a website. Moreover, this is so because it offers many inherent advantages like it is easy to operate, much cheaper than other options, has many existing plugins and more developed each day, SEO becomes achievable and so on. However, a very annoying and sometimes even infuriating problem with WordPress websites is slow loading speed. Ask any developer and they would say that they are constantly looking for solutions that help the loading of WordPress websites faster. Many bloggers and developers who work on WordPress platform are now turning towards "dockerized servers" to serve the same purpose. These "dockerized servers" ensure that you have sufficient resources along with inbuilt cache plugins and a choice to add a CDN and thus helping your website to load blazingly fast.</p>

<b>What is a container technology and why was it needed?</b>

<p style="text-align:justify">Developers would agree that most of the times the test environments and production environments are not similar. They differ at many levels. There can be a difference in the network topology or storage or may be even certain security policies. However, a developer has to ensure a smooth running of his software irrespective of the supporting environment of the software.  Here container technology comes in.  Containers take away the effect that an application might have on it due to changes in any OS distributions and underlying infrastructure. It provides everything an application might require to run properly in a single environment.</p>

<b>What are Docker and Dockerized servers?</b>

<p style="text-align:justify">Docker, which appeared on the IT scene a couple of years back has managed to achieve the aim of which it built. It thus has now become synonymous with container technology. Its success can clearly estimate from the fact that big giants like Amazon, Google and  Microsoft are showing interest in using it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Founded by Solomon Hykes and situated in San Francisco, California; Docker Inc came up with Docker open source project in early 2013 and since then there has been no looking back. What Docker does is that is that it envelopes a software along with everything that might be needed to run it, and installed on a server.  So now all the stuff like code, runtime, libraries, tools required for running a particular software there as a single entity. The result is that this software run in the same fashion each time, whatever be supporting environment. It frees the software from any effect that it might have due to any changes around this standardized unit. Whatever be the infrastructure around, any change in computer or cloud or whatever, the software runs just the way the developer intended it to run. Docker containers are hot for all the right reasons! It is just awesome!</p>

<b>Benefits of using Dockerized server</b>

<p style="text-align:justify">There are many inherent advantages that one can have by using a "Dockerized Server." Let's look at the major ones:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It ensures that there is a no conflict and no issue process when the software goes from development stage to production stage. No intervention required for this transition, and it becomes smooth and quick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We do away with portability issues when we choose docker. Whatever be the machine to which the software transferred, if it runs Docker, running the software is not a problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Even if your software undergoes many developmental steps, and is released more than once, the environment consistency is not disturbed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Having a docker ensures having a software's dedicated resources. It does not eat resources from other and neither have to part with its own.
Maintaining a docker is easy, and it is safe too.</p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p style="text-align:justify">Using a "Dockerized Server" can help you get many applications running using the same amount of hardware. A lot of money saved in a long term. You can squeeze out maximum performance from a server when it is dockerized.</p>
